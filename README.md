## Description

This web app helps you manage labels and milestones of your GitHub repositories.

This project was originally forked from [here](https://github.com/destan/github-label-manager) in early 2020. However, since it hadn't been updated since 2016, we took it into our own hands to fix bugs and add new features requested by the GitHub community.

We are proud to continue developing and maintaining this open-source project for the community. We have made significant improvements:

- Now able to manage milestones in addition to labels.
- Replaced jQuery Ajax with JavaScript's native Fetch API in promise style.
- Fire API calls asynchronously in parallel to improve the efficiency by > 100%.
- Display entries (labels and milestones) in alphabetical order.
- Added data validation before committing changes.
- Refined the UI to a modern and responsive design with meticulous attention to details.
- Upgraded from Bootstrap 2 to Bootstrap 4 with Material Design.
- Upgraded from jQuery 1.x.x to the latest jQuery 3.x.x.
- The code is modularized and bundled by Webpack to create a production build.
- Fixed numerous bugs.
- Many more features to come.
