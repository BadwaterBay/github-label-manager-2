## Description

This web app helps you manage labels and milestones.

This project was adopted from [here](https://github.com/destan/github-label-manager). However, since that project hasn't been updated since 2016, we'd like to take this project into our own hands and continue developing and maintaining this open-source project for the community.

We have made significant improvements since then:
